# Retrieval-Augmented Generation
The Impact of Larger Context Windows: Large models with bigger
context windows can process a wider range of text, raising the question of
whether to provide the entire set of documents or just the relevant
information. While providing the complete set of documents allows the
model to draw insights from a broader context, it has drawbacks:
1. Increased latency due to processing larger amounts of text.
2. Potential accuracy decline if relevant information is scattered
throughout the document.
3. Inefficient resource usage, especially with large datasets.

When deciding between providing the entire set of documents or just the
relevant information, consider the applicationâ€™s requirements and
limitations, such as acceptable latency, desired accuracy, and available
computational resources.
